CurveComparer
=============

Implementation of several common curve algorithms, with UI to demonstrate them

Includes a UI to demonstrate curve algorithms, and includes implementations of Bezier, Hermite, B-Spline, and corner-cutting algorithms. All curve code has been written to be easily pulled and used elsewhere, though constants have been hard-coded in :(  If there's any interest, I can extract the constants to make the code files more extensible. Really, this is meant as an educational tool to get to understand how various curve algorithms work. As such, please enjoy, and feel free to use the code however you wish.
